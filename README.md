This is the Asp.net MVC project which is based on Transport Renting Management.
In which we have 4 tables, 2 tables for planing the packages and premiums 
where Packages are parent table and premium is the child table 

that is connected by their repected Ids. This section of the project will allow user to create Premiums with respect to their packages 
like for their families, Groups and pantner 
Other two table is for clients and vehicles the will allow user to choose the transport campanies and thier respected vehicles.
I have customised css like buttons and background colors I tried to change some layouts 
I wonder that I can I connected this two tables that are clients and vehicle  in to Package to complete the projected fully
but when I try to connected it I crash my project and 
evetually whole project become trash, I have seen many video about that but couldn't find the solution
I love to watch that how to connected the these tables to the packages
also I tried change the nav layout to verticle but that doen't work I wish to watch that too ;]
thank you for reading this I really appericate that you read this ugly readme
